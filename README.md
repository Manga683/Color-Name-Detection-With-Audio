# Color-Name-Detection-With-Audio
color detection is the  process of detecting color names and convert that names in to audio by taking image through webcam or specified image path.
Colour detection is the process of detecting the name of any color.It seems veryeasy. Well, for humans this is an extremely easy task but for computers, it is notstraightforward. Human eyes and brains work together to translate light into color. Lightreceptors that are present in our eyes transmit the signal to the brain. Our brain thenrecognizes the color. Since childhood, we have mapped certain lights with their colornames. We will be using the somewhat same strategy to detect color names.
ln this color detection Python project, we are going to build an application through whichyou can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will
have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate thedistance from each color and find the shortest one.
Text to speech (TTS) is a useful technology that converts any text into speech signal.It can be utilized for various purposes.you just have to sit down and type 
what you want to hear.TTS Reader is a TTS system that allows you to read RTF or TXT files out loud and save them for MP3 or WAV files.It proves to be useful for when you 
need to tune in to archieve while performing multiple tasks.Here we used gTTS API.gTTS is a very easy to use tool which converts the text entered ,into audio which can 
be saved as a mp3 file.
	Here in our project we merge these projects as one which will convert detected color and its RGB values text format into audio format which help people to know which 
  color it is with out seeing that color.
